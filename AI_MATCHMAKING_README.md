# TurfX AI Matchmaking System

## Overview

The TurfX AI Matchmaking System is designed to create balanced teams for sports matches, with a focus on football (5v5). The system uses player attributes such as skill level, position, location, availability, and past match history to suggest optimal player matchups.

## Features

- **Skill-based Matchmaking**: Creates balanced teams based on player skill levels
- **Position-aware Team Formation**: Ensures teams have appropriate position coverage
- **Synergy Scoring**: Tracks and utilizes player compatibility based on past matches
- **Location & Availability Matching**: Considers player location and time preferences
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides a match quality score with detailed breakdown
- **AI Learning**: Improves recommendations over time based on match outcomes

## Implementation

The system is implemented in two parts:

1. **Basic Implementation** (`football-matchmaking.js`): A standalone implementation that uses synthetic player data to create balanced teams.

2. **Advanced Implementation** (`advanced-football-matchmaking.js`): Integrates with the FastAPI backend AI service and includes learning capabilities.

## How It Works

### Basic Matchmaking Algorithm

The basic algorithm follows these steps:

1. Filter available players based on match time
2. Sort players by skill level
3. Create teams using alternating selection (like playground pick)
4. Calculate match quality based on:
   - Skill balance between teams
   - Team synergy scores
   - Availability match
   - Location compatibility

### Advanced Matchmaking Algorithm

The advanced algorithm adds these features:

1. Integration with FastAPI AI service
2. Position-based team formation
3. Multiple team formation strategies with quality comparison
4. Learning from match outcomes to update player synergy scores
5. Model updates via the AI service

## Match Quality Metrics

The system calculates match quality using several factors:

- **Skill Balance**: How evenly distributed skills are between teams (0-100%)
- **Team Synergy**: How well players work together based on past matches (0-100%)
- **Availability Match**: How well the match time fits player schedules (0-100%)
- **Location Compatibility**: How convenient the location is for players (0-100%)
- **Position Balance**: How well positions are covered in each team (0-100%)

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```javascript
// Run the basic matchmaking
node football-matchmaking.js
```

### Advanced Usage

```javascript
// Run the advanced matchmaking with AI integration
node advanced-football-matchmaking.js
```

### Testing

```javascript
// Test the basic implementation
node test-football-matchmaking.js

// Test the advanced implementation
node test-advanced-matchmaking.js
```

## Sample Output

```

## Future Improvements

1. **Enhanced Learning**: Implement more sophisticated machine learning algorithms
2. **Player Preferences**: Consider player preferences for teammates and opponents
3. **Match History Analysis**: Deeper analysis of past match data
4. **Dynamic Skill Assessment**: Adjust skill ratings based on performance
5. **Multi-sport Support**: Extend to other sports beyond football

## Integration with TurfX Platform

This AI matchmaking system integrates with the TurfX platform through:

1. The FastAPI backend service (`ai_matchmaking/main.py`)
2. The Node.js Express API (`controllers/aiMatchmakingController.js`)
3. The matchmaking service (`services/matchmakingService.js`)

The system is designed to evolve as real player data and match history become available, continuously improving matchmaking quality over time.
